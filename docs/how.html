              We do not store ANY end user data, except for a key-value pair of emails and webhook links.<br>
              End user data is temporarily read when an email is recieved and is removed by the JavaScript garbage collector once processed and sent to Discord Inc.<br>
              The generated infromation is not stored, and only sends the data required to recieve a message within Discord.<br>
              Except for explicitly enabled logging emails, no information about emails are stored by the service.<br>

              In the scenario in which you may wish to terminate the use of DiscordMailHooks, you only need to delete the webhook associated with the webhook address.<br>
              Note that websites which your account may be associated with will not be notified of the termination, and may still send emails to us after your webhook is deleted.<br>
              In such a case, these emails are processed but are not transmitted, sent, saved or printed, and any information stored will not be accessable.<br>
              It is therefore advised to remove emails associated with DiscordMailHooks first before your termination.
